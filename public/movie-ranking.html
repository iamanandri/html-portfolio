<h1>The Best Movies According to Irfan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Oldboy</h3>
<p>It's a very tragic movie about revenge.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Interesting movie to figure out. It's shown in non-sequential order</p>
<h3>The Raid: Redemption</h3>
<p>Action movie that came from my home country of Indonesia, so there's a bit of bias there.</p>
